We show that WK linear grammars can generate some context-sensitive languages. Moreover, we demonstrate that the family of WK regular languages is the proper subset of the family of WK linear languages, but it is not comparable with the family of linear languages. We also establish that the Watson-Crick regular grammars are closed under almost all of the main closure operations.},

	abstract = {Watson–Crick automata are finite state automata working on double-stranded tapes, introduced to investigate the potential of DNA molecules for computing. In this paper, we continue the investigation of descriptional complexity of Watson–Crick automata initiated by Păun et al. [A. Păun, M. Păun, State and transition complexity of Watson–Crick finite automata, in: G. Ciobanu, G. Paun (Eds.), Fundamentals of Computation Theory, FCT’99, in: LNCS, vol. 1684, 1999, pp. 409–420]. In particular, we show that any finite language, as well as any unary regular language, can be recognized by a Watson–Crick automaton with only two, and respectively three, states. Also, we formally define the notion of determinism for these systems. Contrary to the case of non-deterministic Watson–Crick automata, we show that, for deterministic ones, the complementarity relation plays a major role in the acceptance power of these systems.},

In this paper we introduce the concept of parallel communicating Watson-Crick automata systems. It consists of several Watson-Crick finite automata parsing independently the same input and exchanging information on request, by communicating states to each other. We investigate the computational power of these systems and prove that they are more powerful than classical Watson-Crick finite automata, but still accepting at most context-sensitive languages. Moreover, if the complementarity relation is injective, then we obtain that this inclusion is strict. For the general case, we also give some closure properties, as well as a characterization of recursively enumerable languages based on these systems.},

Extensive research work has already been done on non-deterministic Watson–Crick automata and on deterministic Watson–Crick automata. State complexity of Watson–Crick automata has also been discussed. In this paper we analyze the state complexity of deterministic Watson–Crick automata with respect to non-deterministic block automata and non-deterministic finite automata. We also introduce new finite automata combining the properties of Watson–Crick automata and time varying automata. These automata have the unique property that the 1-limited stateless variant of these automata have the power to count. We further discuss the state complexity of time varying automata and time varying Watson–Crick automata.},

	abstract = {In [4, page166], it is asked what influence the complementarity relation plays as far as the expressiveness of sticker systems and Watson-Crick automata are concerned. Here, we give the answer: (almost) none! More precisely, we show that every language L of a sticker system or a Watson-Crick automaton is the language of such a system with a one-to-one complementarity relation. Our second group of results shows that L is the inverse block coding of a language from the same family over any nontrivial fixed complementarity relation. Finally, we prove that any Watson-Crick automaton can be transformed into an equivalent simple and all-final one. This implies the collapse of parts of the hierarchy introduced in [4].},
